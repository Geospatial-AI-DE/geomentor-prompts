# 🌍 Spatial Analysis

## 🏷️ **Category:** Image Analysis
## 👤 **Persona:** Data Scientist

### 🎯 **Objective**
To apply geospatial analysis techniques to determine locations, identify spatial patterns, and track changes over time, leveraging maps and geospatial data science methodologies for better decision-making.

### 📝 **Prompt Template**
#### 🛠 AI Agent Task:
- Load and analyze the attached map image
- Identify key locations, patterns, and spatial changes.
- Generate descriptive insights based on the detected spatial information.
- Suggest potential geospatial operations (e.g., clustering, object detection, feature extraction).
- Provide visualization recommendations for better interpretation.

#### 🔧 Usage Instructions:
1. Attach a map image.
2. Specify the type of spatial analysis needed (e.g., pattern detection, change analysis).
3. Run the AI agent to extract insights.
4. Review the suggested geospatial operations and visualizations.
