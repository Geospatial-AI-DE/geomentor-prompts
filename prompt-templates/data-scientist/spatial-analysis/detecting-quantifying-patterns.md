# 🔍 Detecting and Quantifying Patterns

## 🏷️ **Category:** Spatial Analysis  
## 👤 **Persona:** Data Scientist

### 🎯 **Objective**
To identify spatial trends, clusters, and anomalies through AI-driven pattern recognition and statistical analysis. This template helps data scientists detect hidden spatial patterns in data for applications ranging from epidemiology to market analysis and environmental monitoring.

### 📝 **Prompt Template**
#### 🛠 AI Agent Task:
- Perform spatial clustering analysis using algorithms like DBSCAN, K-means, and hierarchical clustering
- Execute hot spot analysis to identify statistically significant spatial clusters
- Detect spatial anomalies and outliers using statistical methods and machine learning
- Analyze spatial autocorrelation patterns using Moran's I and Geary's C statistics
- Identify emerging trends and change patterns over time and space
- Apply point pattern analysis to understand distribution characteristics
- Generate spatial regression models to quantify pattern relationships
- Assess pattern significance and provide statistical confidence measures

#### 🔧 Usage Instructions:
1. Upload spatial datasets with point locations, values, or time-series data
