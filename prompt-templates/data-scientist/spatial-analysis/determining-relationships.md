# 🔗 Determining How Places Are Related

## 🏷️ **Category:** Spatial Analysis  
## 👤 **Persona:** Data Scientist

### 🎯 **Objective**
To analyze spatial relationships, connectivity, and interactions between geographic locations through AI-driven network and proximity analysis. This template helps data scientists understand how places influence each other and identify spatial dependencies and connections.

### 📝 **Prompt Template**
#### 🛠 AI Agent Task:
- Perform proximity analysis to identify neighboring features and buffer zones
- Calculate spatial correlation and autocorrelation metrics between locations
- Execute network analysis to determine connectivity and accessibility patterns
- Analyze flow patterns and movement corridors between geographic areas
- Assess spatial clustering and identify similar geographic regions
- Measure spatial impedance, friction, and cost-distance relationships
- Generate connectivity matrices and adjacency relationships
- Evaluate spatial spillover effects and influence zones between places

#### 🔧 Usage Instructions:
1. Provide spatial datasets with location coordinates or network topology data
2. Define the type of spatial relationship to analyze (proximity, connectivity, similarity)
3. Specify distance thresholds, network constraints, or relationship criteria
4. Set analysis parameters for buffer distances, correlation methods, or flow calculations
5. Run the AI agent to compute spatial relationships and network metrics
6. Review relationship matrices, correlation coefficients, and connectivity results
7. Export network diagrams, relationship maps, and statistical summaries

### 💡 **Example Use Cases:**
- Transportation network connectivity and route efficiency analysis
- Supply chain logistics and distribution network optimization
- Social network analysis with geographic constraints
- Epidemiological contact tracing and disease transmission pathways
- Economic spillover effects between neighboring regions
- Environmental connectivity corridors for wildlife migration
