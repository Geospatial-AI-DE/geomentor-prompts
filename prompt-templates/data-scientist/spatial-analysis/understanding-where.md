# 🌍 Understanding Where

## 🏷️ **Category:** Spatial Analysis  
## 👤 **Persona:** Data Scientist

### 🎯 **Objective**
To identify geographic distributions, locate key sites, and visualize spatial patterns through AI-driven geospatial analysis. This template helps data scientists leverage spatial intelligence to understand the geographic context and distribution of data points, features, and phenomena.

### 📝 **Prompt Template**
#### 🛠 AI Agent Task:
- Analyze the provided geospatial dataset or coordinates to identify geographic distributions and patterns
- Perform geocoding operations to convert addresses or place names into geographic coordinates
- Generate spatial queries to locate key sites, landmarks, or areas of interest
- Create density maps and heatmaps to visualize concentration patterns
- Identify geographic clusters and outliers in the spatial data
- Provide insights on spatial accessibility and proximity relationships
- Suggest appropriate coordinate reference systems and map projections for visualization

#### 🔧 Usage Instructions:
1. Upload your geospatial dataset (CSV, GeoJSON, Shapefile, or provide coordinates/addresses)
2. Specify the type of geographic analysis needed (e.g., distribution mapping, site identification, density analysis)
3. Define the geographic scope and scale of analysis (local, regional, national, global)
4. Run the AI agent to extract spatial insights and generate visualizations
5. Review the geographic patterns identified and spatial recommendations provided
6. Export results in preferred formats (maps, coordinates, statistical summaries)

### 💡 **Example Use Cases:**
- Mapping customer distribution across service areas
- Identifying optimal locations for retail stores or facilities
- Analyzing crime hotspots and emergency response coverage
- Visualizing disease outbreak patterns and healthcare accessibility
- Understanding demographic distributions and urban planning needs
